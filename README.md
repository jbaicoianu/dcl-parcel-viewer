# Decentraland Parcel Viewer
## Garbage code for a garbage project
### What is this?
This code comes from some experiments to render Decentraland plots in the web browser before any official clients were available. It was the first working system that allowed users to walk through the Decentraland world, seamlessly loading new parcels in the player's vicinity.

The project was discontinued due to the poor reception it received from DCL corporate, and my lack of interest in helping them for free.  It's being released due to repeated requests from the DCL community.  It probably doesn't work anymore.

### License
This project is released under the DGAF license.  I don't care what anyone does with this code.  Go nuts.
